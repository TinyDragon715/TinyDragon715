I am confident my ten years of programming experience makes me an exemplary contender for any web/mobile development work.

As a hard-working Full Stack Developer who has been building web apps for the past 10 years, I continue to love and enjoy creating, learning, and growing with creative industries. Along with a specialty in Full-Stack development with Vue.js, React.js and PHP.
My development skills also include a high-level understanding of MVC architecture, Custom RestAPI Development, API Integration, API Testing Automation, and Deployment.

Throughout my career, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with a team of talented designers and developers, as well as the opportunity to work as an independent contractor. This has led me to a path of being proactive in my skill levels. Adaptability has become my second nature.

Currently, my focus lies on being an asset, and in collectively working towards an organization's success.
